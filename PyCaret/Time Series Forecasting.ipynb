It is an end-to-end machine learning and model management tool that exponentially speeds up the experiment cycle and makes you more productive.\n","\n","Compared with the other open-source machine learning libraries, PyCaret is an alternate low-code library that can be used to replace hundreds of lines of code with a few lines only. This makes experiments exponentially fast and efficient. PyCaret is essentially a Python wrapper around several machine learning libraries and frameworks, such as scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, spaCy, Optuna, Hyperopt, Ray, and a few more.\n","\n","The design and simplicity of PyCaret are inspired by the emerging role of citizen data scientists, a term first used by Gartner. Citizen Data Scientists are power users who can perform both simple and moderately sophisticated analytical tasks that would previously have required more technical expertise.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"8116e19d","metadata":{"id":"8116e19d"},"source":["# 💻 Installation\n","\n","PyCaret is tested and supported on the following 64-bit systems:\n","- Python 3.7 – 3.10\n","- Python 3.9 for Ubuntu only\n","- Ubuntu 16.04 or later\n","- Windows 7 or later\n","\n","You can install PyCaret with Python's pip package manager:\n","\n","`pip install pycaret`\n","\n","PyCaret's default installation will not install all the extra dependencies automatically.
