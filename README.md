# AutoML with PyCaret

## üöÄ Brief Introduction to PyCaret

PyCaret is an open-source, low-code machine learning library designed to simplify the entire machine learning workflow. It offers a consistent interface for various machine learning tasks, including classification, regression, clustering, and time series forecasting. With PyCaret, you can build, compare, tune, and deploy models quickly, all while focusing on what matters most‚Äîextracting insights from data. Its seamless integration with popular Python libraries and support for interactive interfaces like Gradio make PyCaret a powerful tool for both beginners and experts in the field.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

Welcome to the **AutoML with PyCaret** repository! This project demonstrates the power of PyCaret, a low-code machine learning library that simplifies the process of model building, comparison, and deployment. PyCaret allows you to quickly and efficiently create ML models with minimal coding, making it a go-to tool for automating the end-to-end machine learning workflow.

This repository contains a collection of projects leveraging PyCaret's AutoML capabilities across various machine learning tasks, organized under the `pycaret` folder. Each project explores a different ML problem, showcasing PyCaret's ease of use and effectiveness:

- **Binary Classification**: Building models to classify data into one of two categories.
- **Regression**: Predicting continuous numerical values based on historical data.
- **Multiclass Classification**: Handling classification problems with more than two classes.
- **Clustering**: Grouping similar data points together without labeled outcomes.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifying outliers or abnormal data points in datasets.
- **Time Series Forecasting**: 
  - **Without Exogenous Variables**: Forecasting future values using only the time series data itself.
  - **With Exogenous Variables**: Forecasting by incorporating external variables that may influence the outcome.
- **PyCaret with Gradio**: Building interactive ML applications using Gradio, demonstrating user-friendly interfaces for model deployment.

## üìÇ Access the PyCaret Files

All project files, including detailed Colab notebooks and supplementary materials, can be found in the [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1X8L78i5A8OdzGskLqkre0LWCnOouHc9k?usp=sharing). This drive contains all the resources you need to explore the models and their implementations.

## üé• Video Walkthrough

I have created a video where I walk through each of the Colab notebooks, explaining the code, the models, and the PyCaret functions used. This video will provide a comprehensive guide to understanding the workflow and applications of AutoML using PyCaret.
